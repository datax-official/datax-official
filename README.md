# Welcome to Data X
## Hi there, I'm Ahmed Ali👋 

**Data Scientist | Analyst  | ML Engineer**

To utilize my knowledge and ideas in the fields of Data Science, Data Analysis, and embedded systems towards the smooth functioning of an organization, I realized that satisfaction is a book of achievement, which holds the learning experience records of doing, trying, twiddling, getting failed, trying again, and finally succeeding in the project.
